									<h1>About me</h1>
									<p>I'm a passionate game developer, always looking for ways to hone my skills!<br/>
									Currently living in Brasília, Brazil. Working with Unity and C# as the preferred engine and programming language respectively. Looking for a dedicated game programmer or programming teacher? Contact me for contracts or job offers!</p>

								<p>Gamer born in 1997, my greatest inspirations are Megaman X and Breath of Fire III! I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science at University of Brasília, but I've already worked on some professional games during the last 2 years of my graduation. I started going to local Game Jams and later I got contracts from small game studios in Brasília. I've worked with a diverse set of professionals from all sorts of backgrounds, communicating with them was never a problem to me. Dealing with new situations made me develop quick thinking, learning and problem solving skills. I value a great work environment, where the team's members respect and enjoy each other's company. I'm also passionate about teaching others what I know, being teaching assistant many times for some courses in my university and a private teacher for those having a hard time understanding the basics of programming.</p>
								<p>I'm currently looking for jobs in the Brasília area or remote jobs with flexible hours due to my university schedule. If you want to contact me, please feel free to send me an email! :)</p>
